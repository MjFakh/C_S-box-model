# C_S-box-model
A coupled carbon sulfur box model
The model is in MATLAB and would simulate the cycling of carbon and sulfur in the ocean-atmosphere system. In addition to the traditional sinks and sources of carbon and sulfur, the model considers pyrite formation as a source of alkalinity generation in the ocean.
